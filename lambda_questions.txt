1.Write a Python program to create a lambda function that adds 15 
to a given number passed in as an argument, also create a lambda 
function that multiplies argument x with argument y and 
print the result.

2.Write a Python program to create a function that takes one argument, 
and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown given number. 
Go to the editor
Sample Output:
Double the number of 15 = 30
Triple the number of 15 = 45
Quadruple the number of 15 = 60
Quintuple the number 15 = 75

3. Write a Python program to filter a list of integers using Lambda.
 Go to the editor
Original list of integers:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Even numbers from the said list:
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Odd numbers from the said list:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

4.Write a Python program to check whether a given string is number 
or not using Lambda.

5.Write a Python program to count the even, odd numbers in a given
 array of integers using Lambda. Go to the editor
Original arrays:
[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]

6.Write a Python program to add two given lists using map and lambda. 
Original list:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
Result: after adding two list
[5, 7, 9]

7.Write a Python program to find numbers divisible by nineteen or 
thirteen from a list of numbers using Lambda.
Orginal list:
[19, 65, 57, 39, 152, 639, 121, 44, 90, 190]
Numbers of the above list divisible by nineteen or thirteen:
[19, 65, 57, 39, 152, 190]

8.Write a Python program that multiply each number of given list 
with a given number using lambda function. Print the result.
Original list: [2, 4, 6, 9, 11]
Given number: 2
